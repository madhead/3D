= Media

== TLDR

Prepare these files (at minimum):

. 1:1 (e.g. 960 × 960) cover GIF with a title
. 4:3 (e.g. 1920 × 1440) cover PNG with a title
. Zero or more 4:3 medias (PNG / GIF)
. 3:2 (e.g. 960 × 640) cover GIF with a title
. 9:11 (e.g. 900 × 1100) cover PNG with a title
. 1.74:1 (e.g. 2048 × 1180) cover PNG with a title with 1.58:1 (1900 × 1200) safe area

Media files are used for:

* Thingiverse
** 4:3 (e.g. 1920 × 1440) cover PNG with a title
** Zero or more 4:3 medias (PNG / GIF)

* Printables
** 4:3 (e.g. 1920 × 1440) cover PNG with a title
** Zero or more 4:3 medias (PNG / GIF)

* GrabCAD
** 3:2 (e.g. 960 × 640) cover GIF with a title, used both as cover and regular media.
** Any other 3:2 media would be fine.

* Cults3D
** 1:1 (e.g. 960 × 960) cover GIF with a title, used both as cover and regular media.
** Any other 3:2 media would be fine.
** Platform's in-built model viewer only rotates the model in one axis (Z axis), so a GIF showing the model from all angles would be nice.

* Thangs
** 9:11 (e.g. 900 × 1100) cover PNG with a title
** Any other 9:11 static media would be fine.

* MyMiniFactory
** 1:1 static medias.

* YouMagine
** 1.74:1 (with safe 1.58:1 area) static medias.

== Aspect Ratios to sizes

3:2 → 1920 × 1280
4:3 → 1920 × 1440
1:1 → 1920 × 1920
9:11 → 900 × 1100
